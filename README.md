# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various features in SQL including: entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), creating new tables with into statements, exporting a CSV file, filtering queries, using join, on(), and order by clause, and using aliases. To accomplish these goals, I was given a fictional situation and data set of six CSV files. 
### Background of Project
Pewlett Hackard, a large company with thousands of employees, is looking toward the future in two ways: (1) offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria and (2) identifying which positions will need to be filled in the near future. The objective of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, and a written a summary analysis report to prepare Pewlett Hackard for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results

![compare_retire_mentor_table](compare_retire_mentor_table.png)

Based on the line graph above, I had the following takeways about theather campaigns:
*There are **499,996** retirement-eligible (born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955) employees. 

*There are **1,549** mentorship-eligible (born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965) employees.


* In every month there were more successful than failed campagins. Generally, the successful and failed trend lines create the same shape and are similar to each other with the exception of May, October, and December. In May, the larger than average gap between successful and failed campaigns suggests a better chance for success. In October, the smaller than average gap between successful and failed campaigns suggests a better chance for failure.

## Summary 
1.	Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
o	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
o	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
